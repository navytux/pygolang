"""Package golang provides Go-like features for Python

- `go` spawns lightweight thread.
- `chan` and `select` provide channels with Go semantic.
- `func` allows to define methods separate from class.
- `defer` allows to schedule a cleanup from the main control flow.
- `gimport` allows to import python modules by full path in a Go workspace.
