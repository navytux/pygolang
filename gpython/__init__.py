"""gpython ... - run python ... with gevent & golang activated

gpython is substitute for standard python interpreter with the following
differences:

- gevent is pre-activated and stdlib is patched to be gevent aware;
- go, chan, select etc are put into builtin namespace;
- default string encoding is always set to UTF-8.
"""

# NOTE gpython is kept out of golang/ , since even just importing e.g. golang.cmd.gpython,
# would import golang, and we need to do gevent monkey-patching ASAP - before that.
#
# we also keep it in gpython/__init__.py instead of gpython.py, since the latter does not
# work correctly with `pip install` (gpython script is installed, but gpython module is not).

# NOTE don't import anything at global scope - we need gevent to be imported first.
