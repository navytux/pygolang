0.0.3 (2019-08-29)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Provide Cython/nogil API with goroutines and channels. Cython API is not only
  faster compared to Python version, but also, due to *nogil* property, allows to
  build concurrent systems without limitations imposed by Python's GIL.
  This work was motivated by wendelin.core__ v2, which, due to its design,
  would deadlock if it tries to take the GIL in its pinner thread.
  Implementation of Python-level goroutines and channels becomes tiny wrapper
  around Cython/nogil API. This brings in ~5x speedup to Python-level `golang`
  package along the way (`commit 1`__, 2__, 3__, 4__, 5__, 6__, 7__, 8__, 9__,
  10__, 11__, 12__, 13__, 14__, 15__, 16__, 17__, 18__, 19__, 20__, 21__, 22__,
  23__, 24__, 25__, 26__, 27__).

- Provide way to install Pygolang with extra requirements in the form of
  `pygolang[<package>]`. For example `pygolang[x.perf.benchlib]` additionally
  selects NumPy, `pygolang[pyx.build]` - everything needed by build system, and
  `pygolang[all]` selects everything (commit__).

  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/89a1061a

- Improve tests to exercise the implementation more thoroughly in many
  places (`commit 1`__, 2__, 3__, 4__, 5__, 6__).

  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/eb8a1fef
  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/c6bb9eb3

- Fix deadlock in `sync.WorkGroup` tests (commit__).

- Fix `@func(cls) def name` not to override `name` in calling context (commit__).

  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/924a808c

- Fix `sync.WorkGroup` to propagate all exception types, not only those derived
  from `Exception` (commit__).

  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/79aab7df

- Replace `threading.Event` with `chan` in `sync.WorkGroup` implementation.
  This removes reliance on outside semaphore+waitlist code and speeds up
  `sync.WorkGroup` along the way (commit__).

  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/78d85cdc

- Speedup `sync.WorkGroup` by not using `@func` at runtime (commit__).

  __ https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/pygolang/commit/94c6160b

- Add benchmarks for `chan`, `select`, `@func` and `defer` (commit__).
